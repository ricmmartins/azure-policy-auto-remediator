# ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Guide â€” Deploy Azure Policy Auto Remediator

This guide walks you through deploying and running the Azure Policy Auto Remediator in your Azure environment.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following:

- Azure Subscription (Owner or Contributor + User Access Administrator roles)
- [Azure CLI installed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and logged in
- Python 3.8+ installed + virtualenv
- [Azure Functions Core Tools installed](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local) (optional but recommended)

---

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare your working folder

Download and unzip the repository ZIP (or clone the repo):

```bash
unzip azure-policy-auto-remediator.zip
cd azure-policy-auto-remediator
```

You should see this structure

```
ðŸ“¦ azure-policy-auto-remediator
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/
â”œâ”€â”€ bicep/
â”œâ”€â”€ function/
â”œâ”€â”€ CONTRIBUTING.md
â”œâ”€â”€ DEPLOY.md
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
```

### 2. Deploy Azure infrastructure using Bicep
This will deploy:

- Storage Account (Function backend)
- Azure Function (empty at first)
- Event Grid Subscription (Policy NonCompliance trigger)
- Managed Identity (Policy Insights Contributor role)

```bash
az deployment sub create --location eastus --template-file /bicep/main.bicep
```

> [!NOTE]
> After completion, check the Azure Portal â†’ the Function App should be visible.


### 3. Prepare and publish Azure Function (Python)
Navigate to the function/ folder:

```bash
cd function
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Publish the function:

Replace <function-app-name> with the name of the deployed Function App from the Azure Portal

```bash
func azure functionapp publish <function-app-name>
```

### ðŸ”‘ Grant Azure Policy permissions to the Function (IMPORTANT)

After deploying the Azure Function, you need to grant its Managed Identity permissions to trigger remediation tasks via Azure Policy.

The required role is:

> **Policy Insights Data Writer (Preview)**

You can assign this role using Azure CLI:

```bash
az role assignment create \
  --assignee <function-managed-identity-object-id> \
  --role "Policy Insights Data Writer (Preview)" \
  --scope /subscriptions/<subscription-id>
```
Replace:

- <function-managed-identity-object-id> â†’ The Object (Principal) ID from the Function App â†’ Azure Portal â†’ Function App â†’ Identity â†’ Object (Principal) ID
- <subscription-id> â†’ Your Azure Subscription ID

> [!NOTE]
> Once this is assigned, the Azure Function can create remediation tasks securely.

### Notes

- The role name **Policy Insights Data Writer (Preview)** is newer and more scoped than Policy Insights Contributor â†’ recommended going forward.
- If missing, `az provider register --namespace Microsoft.PolicyInsights` may be needed (very rare).

> [!NOTE]
> Once published â†’ the function is live and ready.

### 4. Validate Event Grid Subscription (optional)
Azure Portal â†’ Event Grid â†’ Event Subscriptions â†’
You should see the subscription â†’ bound to your Azure Function.

Event Type Filter â†’ Microsoft.PolicyInsights.PolicyStatesChanged

> [!NOTE]
> This means â†’ Any non-compliance will now trigger the Function automatically.


### 5. Test end-to-end (optional but recommended)
Create and assign a DeployIfNotExists or Modify Azure Policy without creating remediation task.

Create a non-compliant resource.

Within a few minutes:

> [!NOTE]
> The Azure Function â†’ triggers â†’ automatically creates remediation task.

Check:

Azure Portal â†’ Azure Policy â†’ Remediation â†’ New task should be visible.

### Success!
From now on:

- Any new non-compliance â†’ triggers Event Grid â†’ triggers Azure Function â†’ remediation task created â†’ Azure Policy remediates automatically.

### Notes
- This solution creates remediation tasks â†’ Azure Policy engine executes them.
- Managed Identity permissions (Policy Insights Contributor) are granted automatically by Bicep.
- Ensure network/RBAC allow the Function to operate.
